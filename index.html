    <div class="description">
      Recently, wildfires have been increasing in frequency and severity like never before, 
      with the UN predicting the number of wildfires to increase by 50% by 2100. 
      There is no doubt that with this staggering increase will come a pressing 
      need to find alternative solutions to both prevent the start of wildfires and mitigate 
      their detrimental effects, which is why our team seeks to find a solution to this using 
      Artificial Intelligence.
