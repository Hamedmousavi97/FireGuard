      Revolutionizing approach to wildfire prediction and prevention with AI technologies

    <div class="description">
      Recently, wildfires have been increasing in frequency and severity like never before, 
      with the UN predicting the number of wildfires to increase by 50% by 2100. 
      There is no doubt that with this staggering increase will come a pressing 
      need to find alternative solutions to both prevent the start of wildfires and mitigate 
      their detrimental effects, which is why our team seeks to find a solution to this using 
      Artificial Intelligence.

      Even protected from the burning flames, people are still at risk of ash and embers 
      falling from the sky. Smoke in the air causes burning eyes and respiratory illnesses, 
      but most importantly lack of oxygen which prevents people from escaping and causes high 
      death rates like in Maui and Greece wildfires in 2023.
